This is a simple Meteor app to play [Soma.fm](http://soma.fm/) HTML5 streams.

Inspired by https://github.com/joe-roth/somafm-popup and the lack of a proper Android app to play Soma.fm streams.
Unfortunately it's still Flash based but that [might change soon](https://twitter.com/SomaFmRusty/status/301773592507588608).
