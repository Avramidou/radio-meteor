This is a simple Meteor app to play [Soma.fm](http://soma.fm/) and other streams through HTML5.

Inspired by https://github.com/joe-roth/somafm-popup and the need for a nice way to play Soma.fm streams,
Paradise radio and soon more.

Available at http://radio.meteor.com/

There's also an Android app built with http://github.com/guaka/meteor-phonegap
